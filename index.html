      <p class="vision-description">“Once poverty is gone, we'll need to build museums to display its horrors to future
        generations. They'll wonder why poverty continued so long in human society - how a few people could live in
        luxury while billions dwelt in misery, deprivation and despair. When we want to help the poor, we usually offer
        them charity. Most often we use charity to avoid recognizing the problem and finding the solution for it.
        Charity becomes a way to shrug off our responsibility. But charity is no solution to poverty. Charity only
        perpetuates poverty by taking the initiative away from the poor. Charity allows us to go ahead with our own
        lives without worrying about the lives of the poor. Charity appeases our consciences.”</p>

          <p class="vision-description">Today is Monday. A memorable day for the Bengali nation. The ruling party Awami League has lost after 15 consecutive years. Former Prime Minister and Awami League President Sheikh Hasina was forced to leave the country due to the quota movement. Sheikh Hasina has left Ganabhaban with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana to a safe place. The long march to Dhaka of the anti-discrimination student movement was held today to make the ongoing non-cooperation movement demanding the resignation of the government a success.</p>
